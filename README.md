This is a simple rock-paper-scissors game with a UI. It's a project from The Odin Project's program.

What I learned:
1. DOM Manipulation
2. Callback functions
3. Creating and merging branches for github
4. Forking a repository

DISCLAIMER: 
The design and styling has not been fully established as of now, as I focused on figuring out the functionality first. However, I will fully establish the overall design once I finish the last project on The Odin Project.

ALSO, I did mess up the branches here, as I did not push anything before making a custom branch, hence, the one I made was considered the main one. I am aware of that mistake and have learned from it.

Right now I am working on: The Calculator Project.
